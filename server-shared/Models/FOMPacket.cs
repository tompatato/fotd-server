/**
 * This file contains all of the packet structures defined in `fom-network/include/fom-network/FOMPacket.h`.
 * 
 * In order for the interop to work correctly and efficiently, ALL of them must:
 * 
 * - Match the C++ structure's data type sizes and layout EXACTLY.
 * - Use only blittable types (no bools, no strings, no arrays, no reference types)
 * - Be marked with `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack = 1)]` to ensure no padding is added.
 * - Use only `readonly` fields to ensure immutability.
